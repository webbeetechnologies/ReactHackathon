# Webbee React Hackathon


## Problem statement:
The company Construction Machine Management Inc. manages a fleet of diverse building machines and rents them out to building companies. The director Mr. Chechnik manages those with multiple paper staple folders. He would like to manage the inventory on his computer and asks you to develop an application for that purpose.  
  

## User stories:
1. As a staff member I want to have different machine types (bull dozers, cranes, chainsaws, ...)
2. As a staff member I would like to specify which attributes the machine type has **once** (weight, power, manufacturing date, ...)
3. As a staff member I want that attributes can be date, text, checkbox or number
4. As a staff member I want that all machines of one type share attributes (all cranes have a weight, manufacture date as well as a maximum lift weight for example)
5. As a staff member I want to set a title for a machine type (Chainsaw, Bulldozer, ...)
6. As a staff member I want to be able to add new machine types as well as to edit or delete existing ones at any time
7. As a staff member I want to have many machines of each machine type ( for example 6 chainsaws from different brands that have different characteristics)
8. As a staff member, I want to be able to filter by machine type (See all chain saws, all bull dozers, ...).
9. As a staff member I want to see all machines grouped by their type on one screen
10. As a staff member I want to be able to add new machines as well as to edit or delete existing ones at any time
11. As a staff member I want to use URL navigation
12. As a staff member I want that everything is saved even after page reload
13. As a staff member I want to use the app on my mobile phone or tablet as well as on the computer

## Do's
- use a library of your choice for the UI.
- use any other library that you consider helpful
- use ES6
- use React
- use Redux for state management
- use create-react-app ([https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app])
- use local storage
- preferably, write function components.

## Dont's
- create an API to store the data to a server.

## Bonus tasks
Bonus tasks will give extra points but cannot affect your score negatively. If you have time left, you should do them.
- use Typescript
- create PWA (progressive web app)


## Due Date  
- starting from the date of receiving the test, you have **until the sun rises again** to submit it.

## Grading
We will grade your project by 5 attributes, each on a scale of 1-10. If an attribute dips below 7 it disqualifies your solution. For every bonus task done well we will add 0,5 points. You need an average score of at least 8 to pass this round.

1. Feature completeness 1-10
2. User friendliness 1-10
3. No edge cases & bug free 1-10
4. Code style & architecture 1-10

## Hints
1. 4/10 people fail on feature completeness because they did not read the project description carefully or asked questions. Our tip: Read carefully, check if your project fullfills every user story and ask if you dont understand something 100 %. You can even ask questions during implementing the project - we are here to help!
2. 5/10 people fail because their code is buggy and they have not tested it properly for edge cases. If you test < 2 hours the chance is high, you belong to this category. Our tip: test your stuff!

## Code review
If you are done, please schedule a code review with me under  [https://tinyurl.com/tobicodereview](https://tinyurl.com/react-code-review). In this call I will grade your code and give you feedback for your personal learning.

### Good luck  🍀
