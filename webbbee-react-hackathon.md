# Webbee React Hackathon

*Questions are always welcome.*


## Problem statement:
The company Construction Machine Management Inc. manages a fleet of diverse building machines and rents them out to building companies. The director Mr. Chechnik manages those with multiple paper staple folders. He would like to digitize his inventory and ask you to develop an application for that purpose.
1. The client has a diverse inventory (excavators, chainsaws, bulldozers) and other machines.
2. For each of those machines he needs to store different information, to be able to provide the information to his customers, when they want to rent out his machines
3. He constantly expands his inventory so he needs to be able to add new items to his inventory as well as new inventory types with different properties. The properties of existing inventory types should also be editable.

  

## Goal
My goal with this test is to give you the ability to show off your skills under close to real world circumstances. In the real world there is almost never unlimited time. Because of that, we as engineers need to find a balance between writing good code and producing results. Therefore I do not expect perfect code but a good balance, that allows you to finish the project in the given deadline.
  

## Demo

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. Inventory data is persisted between page reloads.

9. On updating the label of a field, the change should also be updated for all items of the category.
10. On deleting an inventory category, the items belonging to the category will also be deleted.
11. Application should be adapted to Mobile, Tablet and Desktop browsers
12. UX should be good; you are free to choose the UI design of your own, and do not have to make a clone of the UI from the demo


## Evaluation
When evaluating your code, I will look at the architecture of your code base, check if you handle edge cases well and follow best practices.


## Do's
- use a library of your choice for the UI.
- use any other library that you consider helpful
- use ES6
- use React
- use Redux for state management
- use create-react-app ([https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app])
- preferably, write function components.

## Dont's
- create an API to store the data to a server.


## Best Practices
- use git to make useful commits during the development of the app
- divide the projects into stages and commit working intermediate results to the repository


## Code Quality
-   Write decent not perfect code, finish in 12 hours but don't just finish the job quick & dirty
-   if I cant easily read your code it will not pass
-   add comments to make your code more understandable


## Bonus tasks
Bonus tasks will give extra points but cannot affect your score negatively. If you have time left, you should do them.
- use Typescript
- create PWA


## Due Date  
- starting from the date of receiving the test, you have **12 hours** to submit it.
- set yourself a timer for 11 hours and plan 1 hour as a margin to test and push a working project
- At most until the midnight it needs to be submitted otherwise it does not pass.


## Submission
- Push the project to Github after completion and send me [shashank@veranstaltungsbutler.de](mailto:shashank@veranstaltungsbutler.de?cc=tobias@veranstaltungsbutler.de&subject=Webbee%20React%20Hackathon%20Repo%20Submission) the repo link
- Schedule code review: [https://tinyurl.com/react-code-review](https://tinyurl.com/react-code-review)

### Good Luck
